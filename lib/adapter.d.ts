/**
 * The harness-facing adapter: an `LlmAdapter` that serves model calls
 * from the public Responses API (`POST /v1/responses`) with the signed-in
 * account's SIWC plan token.
 *
 * The adapter never signs anyone in — interactive login belongs to the
 * CLI and the settings surface. It only uses stored credentials:
 * `ensureAccessToken` refreshes a near-expiry token non-interactively,
 * and a missing/revoked credential fails as an `AUTH` LlmError naming
 * the fix. Plan usage is checked from the account's granted scopes
 * before any request is sent; identity alone never enables a call.
 *
 * Stream translation: Responses SSE events become harness StreamChunks —
 * text and reasoning deltas open text/reasoning blocks, function-call
 * argument deltas open tool-call blocks, `response.completed` yields
 * usage (input tokens reported uncached, per the TokenUsage contract)
 * and the finish chunk. Provider failures — including the
 * `subscription_sharing_*` family, before or mid-stream — surface as
 * LlmErrors carrying the plain-language explanation from errors.ts.
